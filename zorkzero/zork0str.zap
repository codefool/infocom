Then, add the four resulting numbers as though they were in base 10, not base 2. This sum should then be adjusted so that each digit is even (0, 2 or 4). Examine the four binary numbers, and determine which one must be reduced in order to create a sum whose digits are all even. Next, determine the number of pebbles you need to take from the appropriate pile in order to achieve the new binary number which will result in the all-even sum. That's your correct move for the current turn! For example, if you had piles of 7, 3, 9, and 2 pebbles, the binary equivalents would be 111, 11, 1001, and 10. The non-binary sum of those four numbers is 1133. If 1001 were reduced to 110, the new sum would be 242 -- all digits even! In order to change 1001 (binary 9) to 110 (binary 6), remove 3 pebbles from pile 3. It's that simple!"

	.GSTR STR?1425,"You are on a giant chessboard."
	.GSTR STR?1426,"explain the puzzle"
	.GSTR STR?1427,"Don't read on until you understand the geography."
	.GSTR STR?1428,"Although you're on a giant chessboard, this isn't a chess puzzle. (That is, you don't have to figure out how to checkmate one of the kings or whatever.) But you do need to know how chess pieces move."
	.GSTR STR?1429,"Actually, there's no puzzle on the Plain at all; but the Plain DOES relate to another puzzle elsewhere in Zork Zero."
	.GSTR STR?1430,"Have you seen a geography which is similar to the Plain?"
	.GSTR STR?1431,"How many rooms are there in the Plain?"
	.GSTR STR?1432,"There are also 64 rooms, arranged in a 8 by 8 matrix, in the Construction area! See those hints."
	.GSTR STR?1433,"getting back from the Plain"
	.GSTR STR?1434,"How did you get here?"
	.GSTR STR?1435,"Just remove the cloak!"
	.GSTR STR?1436,"read this note about riddles!"
	.GSTR STR?1437,"Riddle hints are in the sections relating to the location where you're asked the riddle."
	.GSTR STR?1438,"killing the jester"
	.GSTR STR?1439,"You can't. There's no way to get the jester to leave you alone. In fact, you wouldn't want him to -- he does some useful things as well as annoying things."
	.GSTR STR?1440,"scroll"
	.GSTR STR?1441,"The scroll is a word puzzle."
	.GSTR STR?1442,"Try rearranging the letters in ""RAM A NAG."""
	.GSTR STR?1443,"They rearrange to ""ANAGRAM,"" of which this message is an example."
	.GSTR STR?1444,"The scroll anagrams to ""ENTER LIBRARY; TOUCH ARMOR THRICE."" So -- do so!"
	.GSTR STR?1445,"slate"
	.GSTR STR?1446,"The first step is finding the tree in question. The dusty old slate refers to the tree as the oldest elm around."
	.GSTR STR?1447,"Examine the slate."
	.GSTR STR?1448,"The slate itself is very old!"
	.GSTR STR?1449,"So, you're looking for what was the oldest elm tree around...a century ago!"
	.GSTR STR?1450,"The elm in question has since died..."
	.GSTR STR?1451,"...and is now the stump in the Outer Bailey."
	.GSTR STR?1452,"Stand on the stump and follow the instructions on the slate (these directions vary each time you play). You've now identified a spot."
	.GSTR STR?1453,"But, as you can tell by the fact that nothing happened, you're not done yet. Do these directions remind you of any sort of classic directions?"
	.GSTR STR?1454,"They're just like the directions you might expect to find on a map leading to buried treasure!"
	.GSTR STR?1455,"Once you've obtained the shovel from Wishyfoo Territory, follow the slate directions from the stump and dig a hole in the ground."
	.GSTR STR?1456,"that pesky bedbug"
	.GSTR STR?1457,"Re-read the jester's parting comment for a clue."
	.GSTR STR?1458,"Also, examine the bedbug."
	.GSTR STR?1459,"The bedbug is very, very tired."
	.GSTR STR?1460,"You need to put it to sleep."
	.GSTR STR?1461,"How would you normally put someone or something to sleep? Like a child, for instance..."
	.GSTR STR?1462,"Try singing a lullaby, or yawning, or lying down, or going to sleep yourself..."
	.GSTR STR?1463,"Alternately, you could use the wand, but that would waste precious wand shots."
	.GSTR STR?1464,"funny paper"
	.GSTR STR?1465,"Read it."
	.GSTR STR?1466,"Once you've gotten to the Crypt, look under the slab mentioned in the funny paper! (The slab in question changes each time you play.)"
	.GSTR STR?1467,"permanent light source"
	.GSTR STR?1468,"Forget the torches. They'll always burn out right away. Look elsewhere."
	.GSTR STR?1469,"You software pirates might as well give up now."
	.GSTR STR?1470,"Peruse your Lives of the Twelve Flatheads calendar."
	.GSTR STR?1471,"Especially the Suspendur FUN FAX."
	.GSTR STR?1472,"Do what this FUN FAX suggests, in order to find Dimwit's secret wing. You'll find a light source there. (Note: there are two locations where you could perform this act -- so try them both!)"
	.GSTR STR?1473,"goal of the game"
	.GSTR STR?1474,"The key to stopping the Curse is contained on the scrap of parchment which fell out of Megaboz's pocket (and which is enclosed in your Zork Zero package). Read it carefully."
	.GSTR STR?1475,"Only the long piece of writing toward the left-center of the scrap is important -- but some of it is cut off."
	.GSTR STR?1476,"This missing text is:
   The Curse cannot...
   Except by...
   Tossing it...
   Then...
"
	.GSTR STR?1477,"Good luck, Blackbeard."
	.GSTR STR?1478,"all those key-shaped buttons"
	.GSTR STR?1479,"Try pushing them, of course!"
	.GSTR STR?1480,"The first time you push a button, it produces a sound. Do these sounds remind you of anything?"
	.GSTR STR?1481,"The sounds are like the sounds made by certain animals..."
	.GSTR STR?1482,"...specifically, the animals covering the rebus!"
	.GSTR STR?1483,"Each time you push a button, one of the rebus animals will go away. There are six buttons, corresponding to the six animals, located in the Closet, the FrobozzCo Basement, the Grotto, the Crag, the Crawl, and the Attic."
	.GSTR STR?1484,"getting the flies"
	.GSTR STR?1485,"You can't catch them, even with the added help of the Frobozz Magic Glove."
	.GSTR STR?1486,"You need to do something magical before you can get the flies. You'll probably know it when you come to it."
	.GSTR STR?1487,"See the hints about the elixir in the Lake Area section."
	.GSTR STR?1488,"read this note first"
	.GSTR STR?1489,"Use this section as a last resort if you can't find the information you need anywhere else in the hints. The first part is a list of the 24 items you need, and where to find them. The second and third parts are a list of how all 1000 points are scored."
